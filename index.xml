      <description>To start, add the following to your build.gradle file:
android { testOptions { unitTests { includeAndroidResources = true } } } dependencies { testImplementation &amp;#39;org.robolectric:robolectric:4.3&amp;#39; } And annotate your test with the Robolectric test runner:
import org.robolectric.RobolectricTestRunner @RunWith(RobolectricTestRunner::class) public class SandwichTest { } We want to test the following class. It represents the device and exposes two methods: √¨sInAirplaneMode and √¨sWithLowBattery. Both of them make use of the Android framework to check if the device is with Airplane mode enabled or if it has enough battery.</description>
